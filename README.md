# NodeJS-Challenge
Project 2 for Class

# Description
The purpose of this project was to create a command line application that has the ability to generate a README file solely using the command line. With this app, future developers can use it to generate a professional README quickly. Which would allow the project creator to devote more time to working on the project.

# Installation Steps


# Usage 
The first step when it comes to using the command line app is to use the command "node index.js", which will then generate questions and with the response of each question the app will generate the README with the specifications that you made.

# License

# Tests
Once in the command line use the "node index.js" command and fill out responses for the questions in regards to the README file that you want to generate.
